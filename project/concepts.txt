/**************    SELECTORS SPECIFITY  **********/

1) Inline styles 
2) ID SELECTORS
3) class, pseudo class selectors (:hover) amd attribute selectors
4) tag selector, pseudo element(::befor) and * universal selector 


/**************    COMBINATORS  **********/

1) Adjacent Siblings :- sibling which is just after the element at sibling level.
                        h2 + p {color:red} :- In this case all p elements which are just after the h2 element.ie. all p which
                         are adjacent sibling of h2 will get red color.

2) General Siblings :- Siblings which are at same level and also need not to be next sibling can be anywhere but should be at same level.
                       h2 ~ p {color:red}. All p which are at same level of h2 gets red color.

3) Direct Child     :- Any direct child will get the styles and not the nested childs to be noted only direct childs.
                       div > p{color:red}. Any p which is direct child and not nested child will get color red.

4) Descendant Child :- Any direct or nested child will get this style no matter where it is.
                       h2 p :- Any p inside h2 either direct or nested child will get this style.

/******************************************** ****    BOX -- SIZING     ****************************************/

-->  By Default box-sizing property is set to content box which means that whatever height and width we will specify will be the height 
     and width of content part only and then after that padding and border will be added so the total width or height of an element 
     may be more than than the specified value.
-->  Use box-sizing border box to avoid this. Border-box will include both margin and padding in total width and height specified and
     will adjust the content part accordingly.


/********************************************    POSITIONING     ****************************************/

--> FIXED   :-  Postion Fixed will take the element out of normal document flow and the element will be positioned at its original place
                only if top,left, bottom or right property is not applied. If these properties are applied then the element will be position
                with respect to the HTML. i.e. the positioning content will be Viewport. width in % will also be with respect to viewport.

                The Containing element of Fixed element is viewport. So width in % will be calculated based on the width of viewport.

--> Absolute:-  This property also takes the element out of the normal document flow.
                If none of the ancestors i.e. parents have a position proerty applied then the positioning context of the element on which
                Absolute position is applied will be the HTML.
                If we have any parent with position property applied except static then the positioning context of that element will be the
                closest parent on which position is applied.

                The containing Block of an Absolute positioned element is the closest ancestor whose position is not static.
                So, width calculation of an Absolute positioned element in % will be with respect to that ancestor and that 
                also content + padding of ancestor will be the total width a/c to which width of Absolute positioned element
                will be calculated.

--> Relative :- Element is not taken out of normal document flow. Element remains in normal document flow. And the positioning content is the
                element itself. i.e. the element will be positioned based on top or left or bottom or right values from its original position
                itself not with respect to its parent or viewport.

                The containing block or parent of a Relative positioned element is any closest block level parent.
                The lengths in % of Relative elements will be calculated bsed on the content of closest block level parent.

/********************************************    IMAGES     ****************************************/

--> Setting height and width on images in 100% will not respect or will not be according to height and width of its 
    parent if the parent is an inline element. To Set the height and width of image in % an in accordance with parent 
    we need to make parent element as inline-block.
